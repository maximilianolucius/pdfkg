  Answer to Question 3: Database Options for Multi-PDF Platform

  For a production platform handling multiple PDFs, you'd want to replace the current file-based persistence with proper databases:

  Current Architecture (File-based)

  data/out/
  ├── chunks.parquet          # Text chunks
  ├── index.faiss            # Vector embeddings
  ├── graph.{cypher,json}    # Knowledge graph
  ├── mentions.parquet       # Cross-references
  └── sections.json          # Document structure

  Recommended Multi-PDF Architecture

  1. Vector Databases (for embeddings/semantic search)

  Best Options:

  🥇 Qdrant (Recommended for your use case)
  - ✅ Open source, self-hosted
  - ✅ Built-in filtering (can filter by PDF/document)
  - ✅ Fast, written in Rust
  - ✅ Great Python SDK
  - ✅ Supports metadata filtering
  # Query specific PDF or all PDFs
  results = qdrant.search(
      collection_name="pdf_chunks",
      query_vector=embedding,
      query_filter={"pdf_id": "manual_123"}  # Optional
  )

  🥈 Weaviate
  - ✅ GraphQL API
  - ✅ Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
  - ✅ Multi-tenancy support
  - ❌ Heavier resource usage

  🥉 Milvus
  - ✅ Highly scalable (billions of vectors)
  - ✅ Great for large deployments
  - ❌ More complex setup
  - ❌ Overkill for <10k documents

  Honorable Mentions:
  - ChromaDB: Super simple, embedded, good for prototypes
  - Pinecone: Managed service, no self-hosting needed
  - pgvector: PostgreSQL extension, if you already use Postgres

  2. Graph Databases (for knowledge graph)

  Best Options:

  🥇 Neo4j
  - ✅ Industry standard for graphs
  - ✅ Cypher query language (you already export to Cypher!)
  - ✅ Great visualization tools
  - ✅ Can handle multi-document graphs
  // Query across all PDFs
  MATCH (doc:Document)-[:CONTAINS]->(section:Section)
  WHERE doc.pdf_id IN ['manual1', 'manual2']
  RETURN section

  // Find cross-PDF references
  MATCH (p1:Paragraph)-[:REFERS_TO]->(fig:Figure)<-[:CONTAINS]-(doc:Document)
  WHERE p1.pdf_id <> doc.pdf_id
  RETURN p1, fig, doc

  🥈 ArangoDB
  - ✅ Multi-model (graph + document + key-value)
  - ✅ Can store chunks AND graph in same DB
  - ✅ Built-in full-text search

  🥉 NetworkX + MongoDB
  - ✅ Your current graph + document store
  - ❌ Less optimized for graph queries

  3. Metadata & Document Store

  PostgreSQL with pgvector
  - ✅ Single DB for metadata + vectors
  - ✅ ACID compliance
  - ✅ JSON support for sections/mentions
  CREATE TABLE pdfs (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      filename TEXT,
      upload_date TIMESTAMP,
      num_pages INT,
      sections JSONB
  );

  CREATE TABLE chunks (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      pdf_id UUID REFERENCES pdfs(id),
      text TEXT,
      embedding vector(384),  -- pgvector
      section_id TEXT,
      page INT
  );

  MongoDB
  - ✅ Flexible schema (good for varied PDF structures)
  - ✅ Easy to store sections/mentions as nested documents
  - ❌ No native vector search (need Atlas or plugin)

  Recommended Stack for Your Platform

  Option A: Simple Stack (Recommended for MVP)

  📦 PDF Storage: Local filesystem (data/input/)
  🔍 Vector Search: Qdrant (self-hosted)
  🕸️  Knowledge Graph: Neo4j Community (self-hosted)
  📊 Metadata: PostgreSQL

  Why:
  - Qdrant: Best balance of features/performance for embeddings
  - Neo4j: Already export Cypher, natural fit
  - PostgreSQL: Reliable, can store chunks.parquet data in tables

  Option B: All-in-One Stack

  📦 Everything: ArangoDB
  - Multi-model DB handles vectors, graph, and documents
  - Simpler deployment (one service)
  - Trade-off: Not as optimized as specialized DBs

  Option C: Cloud-Native Stack

  🔍 Vector Search: Pinecone (managed)
  🕸️  Knowledge Graph: Neo4j Aura (managed)
  📊 Metadata: Supabase/PostgreSQL (managed)
