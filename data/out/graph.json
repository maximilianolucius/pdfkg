The device is designed to be mounted on pneumatic \nactuators of process valves for the control of media.\n\t\n▶Do not use the device outdoors without protection from the \nweather.\n\t\n▶Use according to the authorized data, operating conditions and \nconditions of use specified as described in this document.\n\t\n▶The device may be used only in conjunction with  \nthird-party devices and components recommended and \nauthorized by Bürkert.\n\t\n▶In view of the large number of options for use, before instal-\nlation, it is essential to study and if necessary to test whet-\nher the control head is suitable for the actual use planned.\n\t\n▶Correct transportation, correct storage and installation and \ncareful use and maintenance are essential for reliable and \nfaultless operation. Explosion hazard! Only those devices are permitted to be installed in a poten-\ntially explosive atmosphere/ hazardous (classified) location \nthat bear the corresponding labeling for the respective area.\n2\t Basic safety instructions\nThe operator is responsible for observing the location-\nspecific safety regulations, also with reference to the \npersonnel. Risk of injury from high pressure in the equipment/device \n\t\n▶Before working on equipment or device, switch off the \npressure and deaerate/drain lines. General hazardous situations:\nTo prevent injury, ensure:\n\t\n▶That the system cannot be activated unintentionally.\n\t\n▶Installation and repair work may be carried out by authori-\nzed technicians only and with the appropriate tools. To prevent damage to property of the device, ensure:\n\t\n▶Do not feed any aggressive or flammable media into the \npilot air port.\n\t\n▶Do not feed any liquids into the pilot air port.\n\t\n▶When unscrewing and screwing in the body casing or the \ntransparent cap, do not hold the actuator of the process \nvalve but the connection housing of Type 8691 REV.2.\n\t\n▶Do not put any loads on the body (e.g. by placing objects \non it or standing on it).\n\t\n▶Do not make any external modifications to the device \nbodies.",
